### HOW are we going to solve the problem?**  
> *Describe technical design of the solution.*
> *Paste here google doc link or link to markdown file, if already written somewhere else*

## Progress Tracker
- [ ] Description complete
- [ ] Proposal drafted 

When prioritized: 
* convert it to an Epic
* schedule it on the roadmap/board

### Get to a prototype at branch.targetvalidation.org:
> Write code + **tests** + docs. Isolate the work in feature branches.  
> Use as many PRs as you need.  
> Write tests in the same or different PRs, as is convenient for you.  
> As each PR is merged, add a comment to this issue referencing the PRs.  

- [ ] Feature tag *Code should have a feature tag to be disabled by default.*
- [ ] Minimal functional testing
- [ ] Minimal docs
- [ ] if on webapp, test a deployment on netlify
       
### Push to staging
- [ ] merged code and pushed to staging.targetvalidation.org
  **PULL request should be reviewed by 1-2 people at least**
- [ ] at least 1 week internal testing?
- [ ] received some feedback/input from users (eg. pharma scientist)

### Deploy
- [ ] in the release notes?
- [ ] documentation updated?		
- [ ] blog post?
- [ ] users that requested it originally informed?

## Make sure you can measure impact
> As dev team we want to know if a new feature are succesful.
> To do that we need to define metrics to assess the impact of each new feature we introduce to the platform
- [ ] metric identified 
- [ ] identify the one metric that matters (OMTM)
