Thanks for wanting to add a feature to Open Targets!  You will be responsible for guiding
your feature through completion, and asking the right people for approvals.  

Large features typically go through three stages: [Alpha, Beta, and Stable]
Each stage requires various approvals from various teams (UX, infrastructure, data-pipeline, webapp). Features require several releases
to reach Stable.
