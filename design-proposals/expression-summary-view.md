As a lab scientist I want to be able to answer key questions about expression from Open Targets site

Improve Protein and RNA expression views in Target Profile so that a lab scientist can answer key questions about expression more easily:
- Where is the target expressed in healthy (normal) tissues?
- Is the target more expressed in some healthy tissues than in others?
- In which tissue(s) is the target most highly expressed?
